# I-Love-You-Card
 The "I Love You" Card is a web page that displays a card with a heart in the center and the words "I Love You" written on it. The card has a red background and white text.

The HTML code for the page includes a div element with an id of "card". Inside the div element, there is a h1 element with the words "I Love You" as its content, and an svg element that contains a heart shape.

The CSS code for the page includes styles for the div element with the id of "card". These styles set the background color to red, set the width and height of the card, and center it on the page. The h1 element is styled to have white text and be centered within the card. The svg element is styled to be positioned in the center of the card and have a white fill color.

The JavaScript code for the page includes an event listener for the "click" event on the card. When the card is clicked, the "I Love You" message is replaced with a new message that says "You're the best!".
